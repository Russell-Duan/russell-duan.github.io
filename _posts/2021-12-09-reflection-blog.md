## What have I achieved?

I successfully visualized the traffic density of LA county by using Plotly and Networkx, and I'm also able to draw the shortest path and to estimate the time taken from A to B. After all, I incorprated these work into a WebApp using Flask.

There are two aspects of my project that I'm proud of. The first aspect is to construct the traffic density map which I have to use Networkx and Plotly simutaneously, and coloring the map is another challenging progress since there isn't a build-in scaling method. The second aspect is to compute the shortest path which I have to connect all the areas but keeping the original nodes. Otherwise, I can't compute the shortest path if they are unconnected.

## How can I improve?

The first thing that I want to improve is the accuracy of the time estimation. My current model is static and makes the prediction based on the past data. Time estimation has been a popular topic for a long time, and there are various machine learning model making the predictions while updating the model based on real-time traffic data.

The second thing that I want to do is to deploy by WebApp rather than just opening and running locally. To do this, I have to get rid of the large data set or figure out another way to deploy my WebApp with the large dataset.

## My project compared to my proposal?

Overall, I believe that I completed what I wrote in my proposal, but there are lots of flaws in my project. Even though I achieved the proposed functionaility, the accuracy and the correctness of my function are not verfied. Since there are a lot of things needed to be improved, I just completed my task and I was far away from perfecting it.

## What have I learned?

Firstly, I gained lots of experiences of Networkx, Ploty, and Flask. I know what Networkx is capable of, how to make interactive graphs, and how to make a WebApp. Secondly, I learned some HTML which is quite amazing and interesting, and I'm able to make an interactive WebPage instead of static ones. Finally, I'm more familiar with git and GitHub where version control and sharing information are important to my future career.

## Future impacts

Developing an WebApp is front-end development which I didn't explore before this project. Since I will be working at back-end, I won't have much chance to explore these front-end stuff. From a bigger picture, I realized what the front-end developers' jobs are and how to better cooperate with them. Also, exploring Networkx in this project is also helpful to my academic career because network data science is more and more important nowdays. I didn't think network analysis could do much at the first place, but now I believed the power of network analysis and Networkx is far beyond our imagination, and I will be paying attention to the area of network dats science.
